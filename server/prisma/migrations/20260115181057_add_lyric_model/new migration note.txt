npx prisma migrate dev --create-only --name add_lyric_model

then the migration file was edited manually, these lines where added:

ALTER TABLE "public"."Lyric" ADD COLUMN "search_vector" tsvector 
  GENERATED ALWAYS AS (to_tsvector('simple', coalesce(content, ''))) STORED;

-- Create GIN index for fast full-text search on lyrics
CREATE INDEX "Lyric_search_vector_idx" ON "public"."Lyric" USING GIN (search_vector);


____________________________________
when making a new migration the prizma will drop these lines upove, so make sure you remove
these files before running npx prisma migrate deploy
